# 100DayReincarnator
100DayReincarnator is Rogue-like videogame where you have 100 days in a new world to defeat the Demon King.
# Status
The game is written in C# using Unity. Currently it is still in development. By the end of summer 2020, I would like to have it published to the Steam store.
# Art Style
All the art in the game is pixel art I created from [PiskelApp](https://www.piskelapp.com/). <p>
Below are some animations. <p>
